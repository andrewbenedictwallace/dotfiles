# hardyoyo's dotfiles

Keeps all my dotfiles in one place, uses [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html) to symlink files one folder deep to the folder above.

I owe a great debt of gratitude to [Andrew Schwartzmeyer (aka andschwa)](https://github.com/andschwa/dotfiles), this is his framework, I just borrowed it to manage my own dotfiles.
